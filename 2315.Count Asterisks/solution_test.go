/**
You are given a string s, where every two consecutive vertical bars '|' are
grouped into a pair. In other words, the 1À¢·µó and 2‚Åø·µà '|' make a pair, the 3 ≥·µà and 4·µó
 ∞ '|' make a pair, and so forth.

 Return the number of '*' in s, excluding the '*' between each pair of '|'.

 Note that each '|' will belong to exactly one pair.


 Example 1:


Input: s = "l|*e*et|c**o|*de|"
Output: 2
Explanation: The considered characters are underlined: "l|*e*et|c**o|*de|".
The characters between the first and second '|' are excluded from the answer.
Also, the characters between the third and fourth '|' are excluded from the
answer.
There are 2 asterisks considered. Therefore, we return 2.

 Example 2:


Input: s = "iamprogrammer"
Output: 0
Explanation: In this example, there are no asterisks in s. Therefore, we return
0.


 Example 3:


Input: s = "yo|uar|e**|b|e***au|tifu|l"
Output: 5
Explanation: The considered characters are underlined: "yo|uar|e**|b|e***au|
tifu|l". There are 5 asterisks considered. Therefore, we return 5.


 Constraints:


 1 <= s.length <= 1000
 s consists of lowercase English letters, vertical bars '|', and asterisks '*'.

 s contains an even number of vertical bars '|'.
