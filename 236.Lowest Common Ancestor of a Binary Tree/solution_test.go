/**
Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes
in the tree.

 According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: ‚ÄúThe lowest common ancestor
is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and
q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).‚Äù


 Example 1:


Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1
Output: 3
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 1 is 3.


 Example 2:


Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 4
Output: 5
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5, since a node can be a descendant of
itself according to the LCA definition.


 Example 3:


Input: root = [1,2], p = 1, q = 2
Output: 1



 Constraints:


 The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [2, 10‚Åµ].
 -10‚Åπ <= Node.val <= 10‚Åπ
 All Node.val are unique.
 p != q
 p and q will exist in the tree.
